### Linux Boot Process:-
	There are the 6 high level stages in Linux boot process.
	1 - BIOS - BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System
	2 - MBR - MBR stands for Master Boot Record.
	3 - GRUB - GRUB stands for Grand Unified Bootloader
	4 - Kernel - 
	5 - init
	6 - Runlevel
		0	Halt
		1	Single-User Mode
		2	Multi-User Mode
		3	Multi-User Mode with Networking
		4	Undefined
		5	display manager GUI
		6	Reboot



	1. BIOS = (Basic Input/Output System)
		It looks for boot loader in floppy, cd-rom, or hard drive.
		Once the boot loader program is detected and loaded into the memory,
		So, in simple terms BIOS Search, loads and executes the MBR Master boot loader Program.
		Once the Master boot loader Program detceted and loaded into memory, BIOS Gives Control to it.
		
		
	2. MBR = (Master Boot Record)
		It is located in the 1st sector of the bootable disk.
		MBR is less than 512 bytes in size.
		This has three components 1) primary boot loader info in 1st 446 bytes 
								2) partition table info in next 64 bytes 
								3) mbr validation check in last 2 bytes.	
		It contains information about GRUB (or LILO in old systems).
		So, in simple terms MBR loads and executes the GRUB boot loader.
		
	3. GRUB = (Grand Unified Bootloader)
		Grub configuration file is /boot/grub/grub.conf
		So, in simple terms GRUB just loads and executes Kernel and initrd images.
		
	4. Kernel = 
		Mounts the root file system as specified in the grub.conf
		Kernel executes the /sbin/init program . Initd is used by kernel as temporary root file system until kernel mounts the root files system. 
		
	5. Init
		Looks at the /etc/inittab file to decide the Linux run level.
		Run levels decide which initil programs are loaded at startup
		Following are the available run levels. 0 – halt, 1 – Single user mode, 2 – Multiuser, without NFS, 3 -CLI,  4 – unused ,5 - Display, nitit 6

	6. Runlevel programs
		Depending on your init level setting, the system will execute the programs from one of the following directory.
		Runlevel0=/etc/rc.d/rc.0d/
		Runlevel1=/etc/rc.d/rc.0d/
		"
		Runlevel6=/etc/rc.d/rc.6d/
		
	
### Please describe the Linux Process.

	There are seven steps to the boot-up sequence. 
	1) BIOS (basic input/output system) – executes the MBR where
	Boot Loader sits, 
	2) MBR- Master boot reads Kernel into memory,
	3) GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) Kernel
	starts Init process, 
	4) Kernel – Kernel executes the /sbin/init program. Init reads inittab, executes rc.sysinit, 
	5) Init
	– the rc script than starts services to reach the default run level and 6) Run level programs – these programs are
	executed from /etc/rc.d/rc*.dl/

	Q What are the Linux boot files?
	1./boot/grub/grub.conf: contains boot disk parameters
	2./etc/fstab: contains File systems which need to mount at boot time
	3./etc/initab: Contains default run level
	4./etc/init.d/rc.d/rcN.d: This is a dir it contains

	Q = /etc/fstab Details
	The first field=device name , The second field=mount point, Third field=filesystem type, The fourth field=describes the mount options., 
	Fifth field contains a 1 if the dump utility should back up a partition or a 0 if it shouldn’t.
	Sixth field specifies the order in which fsck checks the device/partition for errors at boot time.A 0 means that fsck should not check a file system.

	Q = Understanding /etc/passwd file fields
	Ans = Username : Passwd X (/etc/shadow file) : User ID : Group ID : User Info : Home directory  : Command/shell

	Q = Reset Root Password in CentOS
	Ans = 1). Restart the system, then tap the Esc key about once per second to launch the GRUB menu.
		2). Use the arrows to highlight the version of Linux you boot into, then press e.
		3). Use the arrows to highlight the line that starts with kernel or Linux. Press E.
		4). At the end of the line Linux16 , type init=/bin/bash OR (rd.break)  . Once done editing press 'ctrl+x'
		5). mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
		6). chroot /sysroot
		6). passwd root
		7). touch /.autorelabel      		(Set SELinux relabeling on next boot)
		8). exit
		9). exit  => reboot
	Q= How to Recover or Rescue Corrupted Grub Boot Loader in CentOS 7
	Ans = 1). centos 7 bootable USB stick. Place the bootable image into your machine appropriate drive and reboot the machine.
		2). select your cd-ROM or USB Drive => secect Troublishooting Option  => Rescue a CentOS system 
		3). Then press Enter => After the installer software loads into your machine RAM, the rescue environment prompt will appear on your screen. 
									On this prompt type 1 in order to Continue with the system recovery process, 
		4). chroot /mnt/sysimage
		5). /sbin/grub2-install /dev/sda
		6). Exit  => reboot   => After machine restart, you should, first, enter BIOS settings and change the boot order menu

### What is File System:- It is responsible for storing information on disk and retrieving and updating this information.

	Diffrent Between Ext4 and XFS
	Ext2
		Ext2 does not have journaling feature.
		On flash drives, usb drives, ext2 is recommended, as it doesn’t need to do the over head of journaling.
		Maximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 2 TB
		Overall ext2 file system size can be from 2 TB to 32 TB
	Ext3
		Starting from Linux Kernel 2.4.15 ext3 was available.
		The main benefit of ext3 is that it allows journaling.
		Journaling has a dedicated area in the file system, where all the changes are tracked. When the system crashes, the possibility of file system corruption is less because of journaling.
		Maximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 2 TB
		Overall ext3 file system size can be from 2 TB to 32 TB
		# mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1
	Ext4
		Ext4 stands for fourth extended file system.It was introduced in 2008.Starting from Linux Kernel 2.6.19 ext4 was available.
		Maximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 16 TB. Overall maximum ext4 file system size is 1 EB (exabyte). 1 EB = 1024 PB 
		In ext4, you also have the option of turning the journaling feature “off”.
		File system check = e2fsck, Resizing a file system = resize2fs, Backup a file system = dump and restore, Create a file system = mkfs.ext4
		# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
	XFS
		The XFS is a high-performance 64-bit journaling file system.The support of the XFS was merged into Linux kernel in around 2002 .
		XFS supports maximum file system size of 8 exbibytes for the 64-bit file system. Now, the RHEL 7.0 uses XFS as the default filesystem with 3.6 kernel.
		File system check = xfs_repair, Resizing a file system = xfs_growfs, Backup a file system = xfsdump and xfsrestore 
		Create File System = mkfs.xfs,
		##mkfs.xfs -f /dev/sdb1 

## Some QA

	Q:- What is filesystem.
	Ans:- Linux File System or any file system generally is a layer which is under the operating system that handles the positioning of your data on the storage, without it; the system cannot knows which file starts from where and ends where.

	JFS: old file system made by IBM. It works very well with small and big files, but it failed and files corrupted after long time use, reports say.
	===================================================================================================================================================================
	/ :	  This is the root directory which should contain only the directories needed at the top level of the file structure

	/bin: Essential User Command Binaries

	/boot: Where boot loader and boot files are located.

	/dev: Where all physical drives are mounted like USBs DVDs.

	/etc: Contains configurations for the installed packages.

	/home: User Home Directory

	/lib: Where the libraries of the installed packages located since libraries shared among all packages

	/media: Removable Media

	/mnt: Where you mount other things Network locations and some distros you may find your mounted USB or DVD.

	/opt: Some optional packages are located here and this is managed by the package manager.

	/proc: Because everything on Linux is a file, this folder for processes running on the system,

	and you can access them and see much info about the current processes.

	/root: The home folder for the root user.

	/sbin: System Binary

	/tmp: Contains the temporary files.

	/usr: User Utility and Application

	/var: Contains system logs and other variable data.

	================================================================================================================================================================
	Linux Process
	All You Need To Know About Processes in Linux 
	Q = Process = A process refers to a program in execution; it’s a running instance of a program. It is made up of the program instruction, 
				data read from files, other programs or input from a system user.

	Types of Processes = There are fundamentally two types of processes in Linux:
	Foreground processes (also referred to as interactive processes) – these are initialized and controlled through a terminal session. In other words,
				there has to be a user connected to the system to start such processes; they haven’t started automatically as part of the system functions/services.
				
	Background processes (also referred to as non-interactive/automatic processes) – are processes not connected to a terminal; they don’t expect any user input.

	Q = How Does Linux Identify Processes?
	Because Linux is a multi-user system, meaning different users can be running various programs on the system, each running instance of a program must be identified uniquely by the kernel.

	And a program is identified by its process ID (PID) as well as it’s parent processes ID (PPID), therefore processes can further be categorized into:
	Parent processes – these are processes that create other processes during run-time.
	Child processes – these processes are created by other processes during run-time.

	Q = The Init Process
	Init process is the mother (parent) of all processes on the system, it’s the first program that is executed when the Linux system boots up;
	it manages all other processes on the system. It is started by the kernel itself, so in principle it does not have a parent process.
	The init process always has process ID of 1. It functions as an adoptive parent for all orphaned processes.

### You can use the pidof command to find the ID of a process:

	pidof systemd
	pidof top
	pidof httpd

### To find the process ID and parent process ID of the current shell, run:

	$ echo $$
	$ echo $PPID

### glances – System Monitoring Tool   (Just Like Top Command)
	# glances
	# Lsof – List Open Files
	# Tcpdump – Network Packet Analyzer
	# Netstat – Network Statistics
	# Htop – Linux Process Monitoring
	# Iotop – Monitor Linux Disk I/O
	# Iostat – Input/Output Statistics
	# IPTraf – Real Time IP LAN Monitoring
	# Psacct or Acct – Monitor User Activity
	# Monit – Linux Process and Services Monitoring (Monit is a free open source and web based process supervision utility that automatically monitors)
	It monitors services like Apache, MySQL, Mail, FTP, ProFTP, Nginx, SSH and so on. The system status can be viewed from the command line or using it own web interface.
	# NetHogs – Monitor Per Process Network Bandwidth
	# iftop – Network Bandwidth Monitoring
	# Arpwatch – Ethernet Activity Monitor

### Process states in Linux

	Different process states now.
	1. Running or Runnable = 
	2. Sleeping or waiting = 
	3. Stopped = 
	4. Zombie =

## QA

	1) What is Linux?
	Linux is an operating system based on UNIX and was first introduced by Linus Torvalds. It is based on the Linux Kernel and can run on 
	different hardware platforms manufactured by Intel, MIPS, HP, IBM, SPARC, and Motorola.(1991)

	2) What is the difference between UNIX and LINUX?
	Unix originally began as a propriety operating system from Bell Laboratories, which later on spawned into different commercial versions.
	On the other hand, Linux is free, open source and intended as a non-propriety operating system for the masses.

	3) What is BASH?
	BASH is short for Bourne Again SHell. It was written by Steve Bourne as a replacement to the original Bourne Shell (represented by /bin/sh). 
	It combines all the features from the original version of Bourne Shell, plus additional functions to make it easier and more convenient to use.
	It has since been adapted as the default shell for most systems running Linux.
	
	4) What is Linux Kernel?
	The Linux Kernel is a low-level systems software whose main role is to manage hardware resources for the user. 
	It is also used to provide an interface for user-level interaction.

	5)What is a shell? What are their names?
	The shell is the part of the system with which the user interacts. A Unix shell interprets commands such as “pwd”,

	5) What is LILO?
	LILO is a boot loader for Linux. It is used mainly to load the Linux operating system into main memory so that it can begin its operations.

	6) What is ilo?
	you access the server remotely, start an iLO remote console session., Power on and power off the server., Restart the server., Monitor the server, 

	6) What is a swap space?
	Swap space is a certain amount of space used by Linux to temporarily hold some programs that are running concurrently. 
	This happens when RAM does not have enough memory to hold all programs that are executing.

	6) How To Create a Linux Swap File.
	When the kernel runs out of memory, it can move idle/inactive processes into swap creating room for active processes in the working memory. 
	This is memory management that involves swapping sections of memory to and from virtual memory.
	Example = In this example, we will create a swap file of size 2GB using the dd command as follows.
	# dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/swapfile bs=1024 count=2097152 (O)R USE THIS (sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile) ,>>  # fallocate --length 2GiB /mnt/swapfile 
	>> #chmod 600 /mnt/swapfile >>
	>># mkswap /mnt/swapfile  >>#swapon /mnt/swapfile   >>#Edit the /etc/fstab 
	/mnt/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0      (/mnt/swapfile – device/file name , swap – defines device mount point , swap – specifies the file-system type , )
												(defaults – describes the mount options, 0 – specifies the option to be used by the dump program , 0 – specifies the fsck command option)
	-
	To set how often the swap file can be used by the kernel, open the /etc/sysctl.conf 
	While the swappiness value of 60 is OK for Desktops, you can put 100 also 
	vm.swappiness=10
	# swapon  -s
	# free

	7)What is a buffer cache?
	The buffer cache is main memory used as a cache to reduce the number of physical read/writes from mass-storage devices.
	The buffer cache is just one of several types of cache used to reduce to a minimum the number of slow operations.


	26. What is YUM?
	YUM stands for Yellow dog Updater,
	YUM, were written by the Linux community as a way to maintain an RPM-based system


	10) What is the basic difference between BASH and DOS?
	- Under BASH, / character is a directory separator and \ acts as an escape character. 
	Under DOS, / serves as a command argument delimiter and \ is the directory separator

	12) Describe the root account.
	The root account is like a systems administrator account and allows you full control of the system. 
	Here you can create and maintain user accounts, assigning different permissions for each account. Symbol #

	11) what is UMASK
	umask is a command that determines the settings of a mask that controls how file permissions are set for newly created files.
	vi ~/.bashrc


	12) What is INODE.
	It is a structure which has the description of all the files and pointers to the data blocks of files stored in it.
	The information contained is file-size, access and modification time, permission and so on.
	Each file is given a unique name by the operating system which is called as the inode.

	13) What is kdump in Linux.
	Ans:- kdump is a feature of the Linux kernel that creates crash dumps in the event of a kernel crash.
		Kdump is an utility used to capture the system core dump in the event of system crashes.

	cat /proc/meminfo
	free - m
	vmstat
	top
	htop

	18) What are symbolic links?

		c) Emergency mode = In emergency mode,The root file system is mounted read-only.

	Q:30 What is load average in Linux ?
	Ans = Load Average is defined as the average sum of the number of process waiting in the run queue and number of
	process currently executing over the period of 1,5 and 15 minutes(exam = " 0.12 1.65 2.3 "). Using the „top‟ and „uptime‟ command we find
	the load average of a linux sever

	20) How do you refer to the parallel port where devices such as printers are connected?
	under Linux you refer to it as /dev/lp . LPT1, LPT2 and LPT3 would therefore be referred to as /dev/lp0, /dev/lp1, or /dev/lp2 under Linux.

	21) Are drives such as hard drive and floppy drives represented with drive letters?

	Serial ports are identified as /dev/ttyS0 to /dev/ttyS7.

	24)Difference Between Hard link and Soft link
	-SoftLink-A file can be accessed through different references pointing to that file is known as a soft link.
	when the original file is deleted file will loss.  only softlink can set on directory not hardlink.
	Its inode number is different. Command = ln -s,.Can be linked To any other file system even networked.Relative Path Allowed.

	-HardLink-A file can be accessed through many different names known as hard links.when the original file is deleted file will 
	Still valid and file can be accessed. "command = ln" .Its inode number	is Same. Can be linked	To its own partition.
	The performance of hard link is better than soft link in some cases. (1=nohard link , 2=hardlink now)

	26) What is the maximum length for a filename under Linux?

	Ques.5. What is a Linux Loader or LILO?
	Ans. Linux loader or LILO is a boot loader for Linux that loads the operating system into memory. Now a days, 
	it is considered more of a legacy application superseded by GRUB(GRand Unified Boot loader) and GRUB2 bootloaders.

	Ques.8. What is a process in Linux?

	Ans. A process is an instance of a program under execution. In Linux, there are two kinds of processes-
	Foreground processes - A foreground process when initiated by a user runs in the foreground and user has to wait for it to 
				get completed before issuing any other command e.g. running any command on the terminal.
	Background processes - A background process runs on the background and the user can execute other commands also even before 
				the background process gets executed completely. Adding '&' after any command, makes it a background process. Also, 
				a background process can be brought to foreground using 'fg' command with jobId of the background job.

### What is latency and why is it such a big deal?  WEB SERVER Site.....................
	In web performance circles, “latency” is the amount of time it takes for the host server to receive and 
	process a request for a page object. The amount of latency depends largely on how far away the user is 
	from the server.
	1.Enable Caching
	2.Optimize and Reduce the Size of Your Images
	3.Minimize Your Code
	4.Use a CDN

### Q = linux round robin

	Round Robin DNS is a technique in which load balancing is performed by a DNS server instead of a strictly dedicated machine. A DNS record has more 
	than one value IP address.When a request is made to the DNS server that serves this record, the answer it gives alternates for each request.
	DNS round-robin is mapping multiple servers to the same hostname, so that when users visit foo.example.com multiple servers are available to handle their requests.

	When you have server back ends built of multiple servers, such as clustered or mirrowed web or file servers, a load balancer provides a single point of entry. 
	Large busy shops spend big money on high-end load balancers that perform a wide range of tasks: proxy, caching, health checks, SSL processing, 
	configurable prioritization, traffic shaping, and lots more.

	But you don't want all that. You need a simple method for distributing workloads across all of your servers and providing a bit of failover and don't 
	care whether it is perfectly efficient. DNS round-robin and subdomain delegation with round-robin provide two simple methods to achieve this.
