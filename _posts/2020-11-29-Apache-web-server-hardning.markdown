### Difference between Apache and Nginx
    1= Apache is a open-source HTTP server whereas Nginx is a high-performance asynchronous web server and reverse proxy server.

    2= While Apache provides a variety of multiprocessing modules to handle client requests and web traffic,
        Nginx is so designed to handle multiple client requests simultaneously with minimal hardware resources.

    3= In Apache HTTP server,single thread is associated with only one connection, whereas a single thread in Nginx can handle
        multiple connections.All the processes are put in an event loop along with other  connections and are managed asynchronously.

    4= It handels dynamic content within the web server itself. Nginx cannot process dynamic content natively.

    5= Modules are dynamically loaded or unloaded making it more flexible. IN Nginx Modules cannot be loaded dynamically.They must be compiled
        within the core sofwate itself.

    6= Apache is designed to be a web server. Nginx is both a web server and proxy server.

    7= A singal thread can only process one connection. but A singal thread can handel multiple connections.


### What is the difference between application server and web server?

    1= Web Server is designed to serve HTTP Content. Application Server can also serve HTTP Content but is not 
        limited to just HTTP. It can be provided other protocol support such as RMI/RPC

    2= Web Server is mostly designed to serve static content, though most Web Servers have plugins to support scripting languages like Perl, 
        PHP, ASP, JSP etc.through which these servers can generate dynamic HTTP content.

    3= Web servers are suitable for static content. Application servers are suitable for dynamic content.

    4= Involve only web or servlet container and cannot be used for EJB.but Could contain a web server as an aggregate part of them and also contain web and EJB containers.

    5= WEB SERVER Not supported Multithreading but APPLICATION SERVER Supports multithreading
    6= WEB SERVER Use HTML and HTTP but APPLICATION SERVER Use Graphical user interface, HTTP, RPC/RMI.

    7= WEB SERVER Provides environment to run Web application but APPLICATION SERVER Provides environment to run Enterprise application.

### Error Codes

        200 successful – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted

        300 redirection error – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
        
        400 client error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled

        500 server error – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request

        501 Not Implemented - The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request.

        502 Bad Gateway    -   The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.

        503 Service Unavailable - The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance).

        504 Gateway Timeout -  The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

        505 HTTP Version Not Supported

        400 Bad Request = It means that the request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. 

        401 Unauthorized = This status code comes when the request requires user authentication.

        403 Forbidden = This status code is the one when the user is not authorized to perform the operation or the resource is unavailable for some reason.

        404 Not Found = This the error code stands for when the requested webpage is not found on the specified server.

        500 Internal Server Error = The 500 are server errors comes when the server encounters an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

### Set all directories to 755, and all files to 644 (VERY VERY IMPORTANT PART )

        If you need a quick way to reset your public_html data to 755 for directories and 644 for files, then you can use something like this:
        ##cd /home/user/domains/domain.com/public_html
        ##find . -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \;
        ##find . -type f -exec chmod 0644 {} \;

        additionally, if you know php runs as the user and not as "apache", then you can set php files to 600, for an extra level of security, eg:
        ##find . -type f -name '*.php' -exec chmod 600 {} \;
        ##find . -type f -name '*.php' -exec chmod 600 {} \;


## Apache Logs

### HOW MANY HITS ON YOUR APACHE Server WITH DATE 

    cut -d'[' -f2 /var/log/httpd/access_log | cut -d':' -f1-3 |uniq -c

### HOW MANY Current USER ON YOUR APACHE Server

    netstat -anp | grep ":80" | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l

    Or if you want total number of hits, take the uniq out:
    cat /var/log/httpd/access_log | cut -d" " -f1 | sort -n | uniq | wc -l
    cat /var/log/httpd/access_log | cut -d" " -f1 | sort -n | wc -l


    WITH IPAddress Take the wc -l off at the end like this to get all the IPAddresses that have visited your site:
    #cat /var/log/httpd/access_log | cut -d" " -f1 | sort -n | uniq       (get ALL IPAddress)

    #ps -ef | grep apache | grep -v gep | wc -l         (to Know connection number)   

### Apache Web Server Security and Hardening Tips

    1. Hide Apache Version and OS Identity from Errors
        ServerSignature Off
        ServerTokens Prod

    2. Disable Directory Listing       & Block Directory Access  
        <Directory /var/www/html>
        Options -Indexes				Require all denied
        </Directory>

    3. Keep updating Apache Regularly
        # httpd -v
        # yum update httpd
        
    3. Secure Apache With HTTPD trace & File Etaging 
        FileETag None       (ETag header)
        TraceEnable off
        Timeout 60
        expose_php = Off

    4. Apache Twiks Enable mod_mpm_worker  
        Worker MPM uses multiple child processes with many threads each. Each thread handles one connection at a time.
        Prefork MPM uses multiple child processes with one thread each and each process handles one connection at a time.
        vim /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-mpm.conf    (Enable MPM Modual)
        <IfModule mpm_worker_module>   
        ServerLimit         	250
        #MaxClients 				512
        StartServers        	10
        MinSpareThreads     	75
        MaxSpareThreads     	250
        ThreadLimit         	10000
        ThreadsPerChild     	1500
        MaxRequestWorkers   	9000
        MaxConnectionsPerChild  500
        </IfModule>
        
        
    5. Limit Request Size    (total size of the HTTP request) (you want to limit the upload size for a particular directory)
        <Directory "/var/www/myweb1/user_uploads">
        LimitRequestBody 512000
        </Directory>


    4. Disable Unnecessary Modules   									(vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf)
        mod_imap, mod_include, mod_info, mod_userdir, mod_autoindex.

    5. Run Apache as separate User and Group
        # User apache
        # groupadd apache
        # useradd -d /var/www/ -g apache -s /bin/nologin apache

    6. Use Allow and Deny to Restrict access to Directories
        <Directory />
        Options None
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
        </Directory>

    7. Use mod_security and mod_evasive Modules to Secure Apache
        Mod_security = Where mod_security works as a firewall for our web applications and allows us to monitor traffic on a real time basis.
        mod_evasive  = Mod_evasive is the module that will protect your Apache server from brute force and DDoS attacks, 
        # yum install mod_security    #  LoadModule security2_module modules/mod_security2.so

    8. Disable Apache’s following of Symbolic Links
        # Enable symbolic links
        Options +FollowSymLinks

    9. Turn off Server Side Includes and CGI Execution
        We can turn off server side includes (mod_include) and CGI execution if not needed and to do so we need to modify main configuration file.
        Options -Includes
        Options -ExecCGI

        <Directory "/var/www/html/web1">
        Options -Includes -ExecCGI
        </Directory>

    10. Limit Request Size    (total size of the HTTP request) (you want to limit the upload size for a particular directory)
        <Directory "/var/www/myweb1/user_uploads">
        LimitRequestBody 512000
        </Directory>

    11. Protect DDOS attacks and Hardening
        TimeOut :300 secs
        MaxClients :256.
        KeepAliveTimeout :  5 secs
        LimitRequestFields : 100


    12. Enable Apache Logging
        <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/example.com/
        ServerName www.example.com
        DirectoryIndex index.htm index.html index.php
        ServerAlias example.com
        ErrorDocument 404 /story.php
        ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/example.com_error_log
        CustomLog /var/log/httpd/example.com_access_log combined
        </VirtualHost>

    13. Securing Apache with SSL Certificates
        # openssl genrsa -des3 -out example.com.key 1024
        # openssl req -new -key example.com.key -out exmaple.csr
        # openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in example.com.com.csr -signkey example.com.com.key -out example.com.com.crt

        <VirtualHost 172.16.25.125:443>
        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/example.com.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/example.com.key
        SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/sf_bundle.crt
        ServerAdmin ravi.saive@example.com
        ServerName example.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/example/
        ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/example.com-error_log
        CustomLog /var/log/httpd/example.com-access_log common
        </VirtualHost>



    14 	Increase PHP Perforance (Tuning PHP)
        vim /etc/php.ini
            short_open_tag = On
            post_max_size = 500M  
            output_buffering = 4096
            max_execution_time = 600

            upload_max_filesize = 200M
            session.gc_maxlifetime = 7200         (Increase apache session time from PHP)
            query_cache_limit = 16M
            query_cache_size = 48M
            key_buffer = 256M
            suhosin.get.max_vars = 10000
            suhosin.post.max_vars = 10000
